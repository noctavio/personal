            <h1>Octavio Munoz, B.S.</h1>
            <p style="font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace; color: red"> Hello!</p>
        
            <p>
                I'm a senior Computer Science major passionate about software engineering and 
                eager to transition into industry. I'm driven by the opportunity to build meaningful 
                solutions that make a real impact. Through my studies and projects, I've developed 
                a strong foundation in software design, development, and best practices. I'm excited 
                to apply my skills to solve real-world problems and grow as an engineer.

            <p>The first project is related to develop a single web page using only two technologies: HTML and CSS. The project consists in creating a single web page with a menu at the top as navigation bar. We have to include text describing yourself and text describing the project. Additionally, we need to include two images: one image is of yourself and second image is anything related to the project itself.</p>
